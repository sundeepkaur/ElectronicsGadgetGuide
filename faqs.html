            <div class="content">
                <p>We know how frustrating this can be. Many computers store web pages on the hard drive to help access web pages more quickly.<br/>
                    What this means is that when your browser retrieves a page from its cache instead of the Internet, the page displayed may not be the most
                    recent version.<br/> If an older version of our flyer appears, first try refreshing the page.<br/> If the problem persists, or you have received an
                    error message, follow your browser’s help menu to clear your computer’s cache.<br/> This should solve the problem.</p></div>

            <button class="collapsible">How will your company handle cash transactions following the government of Canada's plan to eliminate the penny ?</button>
            <div class="content">
                <p>The Government of Canada is phasing out the penny.<br/> Starting February 4, 2013, pennies will no longer be distributed to businesses or financial institutions.<br/>
                    In our location, pennies will continue to be accepted. For cash payments where change is owed, your change will be rounded to the nearest five-cent increment<br/>
                    using the following Government of Canada rounding guidelines:<br/><br/>

                    • Amounts ending in 1 cent and 2 cents are rounded down to the nearest 10 cents<br/>
                    • Amounts ending in 3 cents and 4 cents are rounded up to the nearest 5 cents<br/>
                    • Amounts ending in 6 cents and 7 cents are rounded down to the nearest 5 cents<br/>
                    • Amounts ending in 8 cents and 9 cents are rounded up to the nearest 10 cents• Amounts ending in 0 cent and 5 cents remain unchanged.<br/>
                    Our rounding approach may not be adopted by third party service providers operating within our store environment.<br/>
                    Please contact with those providers directly if you have any questions about their rounding policies related to the elimination of the penny.<br/><br/>

                    Electronic transactions such as debit and credit cards don’t need to be rounded, and will not be impacted.<br/>

                    For more information, please visit the Government of Canada “Phasing out the Penny” site at www.actionplan.gc.ca/penny or call 1 800 O-Canada.</p></div>
