2.CSS: style sheets, in a nutshell, make HTML more beautiful and neat, like decorating a house.
3.JS/jQuery: generally used to perform interactive events, such as verifying that you entered the correct content when submitting a form, and allowing the secondary menu to pop up when the mouse passes the menu, mainly to make your house more intelligent.
In addition to the above technologies, we may use Photoshop to create the images we want in the process of building a website, and also use FLASH to create some animations to support dynamic web pages.
Deliverables: A responsive Website through which audience can get information about the electronic gadgets and they can compare similar category products.
